    * Non-Uniform B-spline.
    * This class is an implementation of nonunform B-splines.
    * Example of notation and terminology.
    *
    * Given the knot vector \f$U = {u_i}\f$ for \f$i \in [0..m]\f$ we use the symbols
    *
    * i   :    0     1   ....   n     n+1     ...    m
    * U   = [ u_0   u_1  ....   u_n  u_{n+1}  ...  u_{n+k} ]
    *
    * Here are some more detailed explanations
    *
    * k       : is the order of the spline
    * m       : is the index of the last entry in the knot vector ie. ( size(U)-1 )
    * m+1     : is the total number of knots
    * n = m-k : is the index of the last entry in the control point array
    * n+1     : is the total number of control points.
    *
    * @tparam U   The knot value container type.
    * @tparam P   The control point container type.
