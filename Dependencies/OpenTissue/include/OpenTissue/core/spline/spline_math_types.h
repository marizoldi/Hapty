    /**
     * Spline Default Math Types.
     * This class is provided as a utility class making it easier for users to get started.
     *
     * The spline library is transparent to the math types. That means that one is
     * not requred to use OpenTissue math types together with the spline library
     * but can use user-customized math types instead.
     *
     * The class assumes that the end-user wants to use the OpenTissue usual
     * math types. If one has a third-party matrix-vector library that one would
     * rather use then one should create ones own math types to be used with the
     * spline library.
     *
     * We have decided to use a math type binder to reduce the uglyness in
     * written template arguments for the functions and classes in the
     * spline library. Thus the main functionality of the type binder is
     * to serve as a collection of types.
